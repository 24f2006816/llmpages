# IITM LLM Code Deployment Platform

This project provides a simple, single-page web application to simulate a code deployment process, designed as a conceptual front-end for the "IITM LLM Code Deployment" initiative. Users can input code, select a deployment target (e.g., web frontend, backend, mobile app, ML model), and an environment (Development, Staging, Production), then initiate a simulated deployment.

## Features

*   **Code Editor:** A resizable text area for users to input their code.
*   **Deployment Target Selection:** A dropdown menu to choose from various application types or services (e.g., Python Backend, Node.js, Mobile App, Serverless Function).
*   **Environment Selection:** Choose between Development, Staging, and Production environments.
*   **Simulated Deployment:** A "Deploy" button triggers a client-side simulation of a deployment process, showing success or failure messages.
*   **Responsive Design:** The interface is built with Tailwind CSS to be fully responsive across different screen sizes.
*   **Instant Feedback:** Provides immediate status updates on the deployment attempt.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For the basic structure of the web page.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive UI development.
*   **JavaScript:** For handling user interactions, simulating the deployment logic, and updating the UI dynamically.

## Setup and Usage

This is a client-side only application and requires no server or build process. 

1.  **Save the file:** Save the content provided for `index.html` as `index.html` in a folder.
2.  **Open in Browser:** Open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
3.  **Input Code:** Paste or type your code into the "Your Code" text area.
4.  **Select Target and Environment:** Choose the appropriate deployment target and environment from the dropdown menus.
5.  **Deploy:** Click the "Deploy Code" button to initiate the simulated deployment. A status message will appear, indicating success or failure.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a single HTML file (`index.html`) which contains all the HTML structure, CSS styling (via Tailwind CSS CDN), and JavaScript logic.

## Contributing

As this is a simulation for the IITM LLM Code Deployment project, contributions are generally managed within the scope of that initiative. However, feel free to fork the project and experiment with the client-side logic.
